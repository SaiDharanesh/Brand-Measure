# Brand-Measure
In this project we are trying to get the required information from customer by having an audio conversation.The obtained audio conversation is analysed and provide feedbacck to the product development team to rectify and enhance the ability/features

We have used 3 important libraries
1)FlashText:
  FlashText is a Python library created specifically for the purpose of searching and replacing words in a document. Now, the way FlashText works is that it requires a word or a 
  list of words and a string. The words which FlashText calls keywords are then searched or replaced in the string.
  
2)Pydub:
  It is used to process the audio files.
  Following are some functionalities that can be performed by pydub:
    Playing audio file.
    We can get certain information of file like length channels.
    Increase/Decrease volume of given .wav file.
    Merging two or more audio files.
    Exporting an audio file.
    Splitting an audio file.
  
3)Symspellpy:
  a Symmetric Delete spelling correction algorithm which provides much higher speed and lower memory consumption.
